# Support Vector Machine

* **Support Vector**ï¼šThe points which are closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors, and the seprating line is defined with the help of those points.
* **Margin**: It is the distance between the hyperplane and the observations closest to the hyperplane(support vectors). In SVM a large margin is considered a good margin. There are two type of margins **hard margin** and **soft margin**.
