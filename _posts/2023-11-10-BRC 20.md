**BRC-20**, or **Bitcoin Request for Comment 20**, is a token standard modeled after the Ethereum protocol's **ERC-20** (Ethereum Request for Comment 20). It was introduced in March 2023 by an anonymous developer known as **Domo**. BRC-20 tokens are essentially Bitcoin's version of ERC-20 tokens, with some key differences.

Here's how BRC-20 works and why it's controversial:

1. **Similar to ERC-20**: Just like ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, BRC-20 tokens allow developers to create tokens that are compatible with the broader Bitcoin network. These tokens can represent a wide range of transferable assets, rights, or even other cryptocurrencies.

2. **Ordinals Inscriptions**: BRC-20 tokens are made possible due to Bitcoin's **November 2021 Taproot upgrade**, which introduced **ordinal inscriptions**. These inscriptions assign a serial number to a **satoshi**, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. The serial number, along with other data, is included in a part of a Bitcoin transaction called the **witness signature field**.

3. **Controversy**: BRC-20 tokens have sparked controversy because they diverge from Bitcoin's original purpose as a simple digital currency. Some argue that introducing tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain dilutes its core value proposition. Additionally, there's concern about potential security risks and regulatory implications.

In summary, BRC-20 tokens are an experiment in minting and transferring fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. While they offer new possibilities, they also raise questions about the fundamental nature of Bitcoin itselfÂ¹Â²Â³. ðŸŒŸ
