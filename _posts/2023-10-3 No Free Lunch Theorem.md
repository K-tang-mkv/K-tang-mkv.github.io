# No Free Lunch Theorem

The No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT) is a theoretical finding in optimization and machine learning. It states that: 
* A general-purpose, universal optimization strategy is impossible.
* The only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the structure of the specific problem under consideration.
* When the performance of all optimization methods is averaged across all conceivable problems, they all perform equally well.
* For certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method.
* No single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems.

The NFLT is often used in optimization and machine learning
